The contract uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations. However, since Solidity version 0.8.0, the language has built-in overflow and underflow protection. The contract is written in Solidity 0.8.19, so the use of SafeMath is redundant. This not only adds unnecessary complexity to the contract but also leads to additional gas costs for contract deployment and function calls.

To resolve this issue, you can remove the SafeMath library and use native Solidity arithmetic operations. Since Solidity 0.8.0 and onwards has built-in overflow and underflow protection, it will automatically revert in case of an overflow or underflow. This will simplify the contract and reduce gas costs. 

Here is an example of how you can change the code:

Instead of:
```solidity
using SafeMath for uint256;
...
uint256 result = a.add(b);
```

You can simply write:
```solidity
uint256 result = a + b;
```

Apply this change to all instances where SafeMath is used in the contract.
