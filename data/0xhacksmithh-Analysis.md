## Overview


## Audit approach
First, by examining the scope of the code, I determined my code review and analysis strategy.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-shell

Accordingly, I analyzed and audited the subject in the following steps;

## 3-Stage Audit Strattegy

- ``The first stage of the audit``

During the initial stage of the audit for Moonwell Protocol, the primary focus was on analyzing gas usage and quality assurance (QA) aspects. This phase of the audit aimed to ensure the efficiency of gas consumption and verify the robustness of the platform.

Found [14 QA Findings](https://code4rena.com/contests/2023-07-moonwell/submit?issue=115)

- ``The second stage of the audit``

In the second stage of the audit for Moonwell Protocol, the focus shifted towards understanding the protocol usage in more detail. This involved identifying and analyzing the important contracts and functions within the system. By examining these key components, the audit aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the protocol's functionality and potential risks. 

- ``The third stage of the audit``

During the third stage of the audit for Moonwell Protocol, the focus was on thoroughly examining and marking any doubtful or vulnerable areas within the protocol. This stage involved conducting comprehensive vulnerability assessments and identifying potential weaknesses in the system. Found ``60-70`` ``vulnerable`` and ``weakness`` code parts all marked with ``@audit tags``.

- ``The fourth stage of the audit``

During the fourth stage of the audit for Moonwell Protocol, a comprehensive analysis and testing of the previously identified doubtful and vulnerable areas were conducted. This stage involved diving deeper into these areas, performing in-depth examinations, and subjecting them to rigorous testing, including fuzzing with various inputs. Finally concluded findings after all research's and tests. Then i reported C4 with proper formats 

Found one medium risk findings [``admin`` may receive less token than expected because of this check  ``_amount == type(uint256).max``](https://code4rena.com/contests/2023-07-moonwell/submit?issue=119)


## Possible Systemic Risks

- ``Smart Contract Vulnerabilities``: The use of inheritance and integration of multiple features can introduce potential smart contract vulnerabilities. Bugs, logic flaws, or improper implementations could lead to exploits and financial losses.

- ``Test Coverage Risks``:  With only 80% test coverage, the protocol may have undiscovered vulnerabilities. Inadequate security audits could leave critical issues unnoticed, increasing the risk of attacks

- ``Governance Challenges``: Understanding Moonbeam and Temporal Governance systems may be complex for some users, potentially leading to governance inefficiencies or suboptimal decision-making.

- ``Chainlink Oracle Risks``: Relying on a single oracle provider, like Chainlink, exposes the protocol to potential risks associated with oracle failures, data manipulation, or centralization issues.

- ``Protocol Fork Risks``: Forking from other protocols may inherit vulnerabilities present in the original codebase. Failure to address these risks could result in potential attacks.

- ``Liquidity and Market Risks``: Insufficient liquidity or market manipulation risks can affect the protocol's stability and overall performance.

## Centralization risks


## Gas Optimizations

1. 

## Risks as per Analysis

- 


## Non-functional aspects

- Aim for high test coverage to validate the contract's behavior and catch potential bugs or vulnerabilities
- The protocol execution flow is not explained in efficient way. 
- Its best to explain over all protocol with architecture is easy to understandings 
- Consider designing the contract to be upgradable or allow for versioning. This can help address issues, introduce new features, or adapt to evolving requirements without disrupting the entire system
