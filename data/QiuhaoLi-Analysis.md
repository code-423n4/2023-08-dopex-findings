The code quality is high, and test coverage is satisfactory. The area where problems arise the most is options funding. The sponsor seems to have not analyzed the possible order of settle(), purchase(), calculateFunding(), and the change of epoch length. Additionally, the price values in some places are incorrect.

There are several centralization risks I am concerned about:

1. The funding reward in PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP can be reused as the collateral of new put options. Only when there are free collaterals can a liquidity provider redeem the LP tokens. So the sponsor (or a whale) can keep calling bond/bondwithdelegate to keep the free collaterals in  PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP small; thus, no one can redeem their collateral and funding rewards. To solve this problem, we can separate the funding rewards and initial tokens from depositors. The funding rewards can always be withdrawn from the LP contract.

2. We rely on the core contract called payFunding() every epoch to incentivize the options' collateral providers. This is a simple centralization risk.

3. Admins of contracts can pause and withdraw all the assets using emergencyWithdraw.

4. The sponsor controls the system parameters, e.g., veDPX Bonding Fee, Reward Distribution Percentages, Discount Factor, and Bond Maturity. It should be better to be governed by the community (governance).
