1. call the ```sync()``` function every time an asset is sent from one contract to the **RdpxV2Core** contract.
   Do this by adding **RdpxV2Core.sync()** in the functions that transfers or pulls assets from the RdpxV2Core contract. For example in the **swap** functions in **UniV2LiquidityAMO** and **UniV3LiquidityAMO** contracts. The sync function can be called anytime but very large amount of swaps can cause calculation issues if no one called the sync function in a very long time but this is very unlikely.

2. In the ```calculateFunding``` function in [**PerpetualAtlanticVault**](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/perp-vault/PerpetualAtlanticVault.sol#L426C7-L427C75) contract we can see that time to expiry is calculated like this : ```timeToExpiry = nextFundingPaymentTimestamp() -(genesis + ((latestFundingPaymentPointer - 1) * fundingDuration));```. Here the **latestFundingPaymentPointer** will eventually only increase since there in no function which will decrease it and the default **fundingDuration** is **7 days** so the time to expiry will become very large at some point. And at the first ```calculateFunding``` function call when the **latestFundingPaymentPointer** is still 0 it calls the ```updateFundingPaymentPointer()``` function which will increment the **latestFundingPaymentPointer** by 1 but in the ```timeToExpiry = nextFundingPaymentTimestamp() -(genesis + ((latestFundingPaymentPointer - 1) * fundingDuration));``` calculation we can see that ```((latestFundingPaymentPointer - 1) * fundingDuration));```
this will be 0 and the **timeToExpiry** for the first one will be just the genesis value.
