## Calculate values only if put options are required
The `calculateBondCost` function from `rdpxV2Core` contract calculates the `strike` and `timeToExpiry` regardless of whether `putOptionsRequired` is true or not. If `putOptionsRequired` is not true, these calculations are redundant and waste gas. To avoid unnecessary calculations and saves gas calculate these values only when `putOptionsRequired` is set to true.

## Calculate minOut only if minAmount is set to zero
The `_curveSwap` function from the `rdpxV2Core` contract always calculates `minOut`, regardless of the value of `minAmount`. After that, in the dpxEthCurvePool.exchange call, the function uses `minAmount` if it's greater than zero. Otherwise, it uses `minOut`. For gas efficiency, it would be advisable to compute `minOut` only when `minAmount` is set to zero.
