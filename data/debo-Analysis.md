Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
I found integer underflow and overflow.

Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
Read the codebase and looked for familiar bugs.  
Then I wrote an exploit for them.  
Then I tested the exploit code.
  
Architecture recommendations
Utilise more AI.

Codebase quality analysis
The code looks great.  There might be some floating pragmas.

Centralization risks
None found.

Mechanism review
Seems like a well oiled machine.  

Systemic risks
Utilise safe math and safe transfer more.
