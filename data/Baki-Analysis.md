# Centralization Risks
They are using a centralized oracle, which is very risky. The protocol should consider using a TWAP or chainlink oracle. As it is better than having a centralized oracle at any time.


# Testing
Protocol has not done enough testing. We definitely recommend to do more testing. It is so low , that we recommend another audit after this review.
