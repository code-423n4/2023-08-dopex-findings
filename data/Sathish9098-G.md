1. USING CALLDATA INSTEAD OF MEMORY FOR READ-ONLY ARGUMENTS IN EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS SAVES GAS 

calldata must be used when declaring an external function's dynamic parameters

When a function with a memory array is called externally, the abi.decode ()  step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the calldata to the memory index. Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas (i.e. 60 * <mem_array>.length). Using calldata directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution. 

2. Using storage instead of memory for structs/arrays saves gas

When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a memory variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) for each field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional MLOAD rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declearing the variable with the memory keyword, declaring the variable with the storage keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incuring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a memory variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires memory, or if the array/struct is being read from another memory array/struct





State variables can be packed into fewer storage slots
If variables occupying the same slot are both written the same function or by the constructor, avoids a separate Gsset (20000 gas). Reads of the variables can also be cheaper

State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage
The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (100 gas) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

Struct can be packed in fewer slots 
Each slot saved can avoid an extra Gsset (20000 gas) for the first setting of the struct.



Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a local variable cache

The instances below point to the second+ access of a value inside a mapping/array, within a function. Caching a mapping’s value in a local storage or calldata variable when the value is accessed [multiple times](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0), saves ~42 gas per access due to not having to recalculate the key’s keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation’s associated stack operations. Caching an array’s struct avoids recalculating the array offsets into memory/calldata


Avoid emitting constants. Combine events 
A log topic (declared with indexed) has a gas cost of Glogtopic (375 gas). The Stake and Withdraw events’ second indexed parameter is a constant for a majority of events emitted (with the exception of the events emitted in the _stakeLP() and _withdrawLP() functions) and is unecessary to emit since the value will never change. Alternatively, you can avoid incurring the Glogtopic (375 gas) per call to any function that emits Stake/Withdraw (with the exception of _stakeLP() and _withdrawLP()) by creating separate events for each staking/withdraw function and opt out of using the current indexed asset topic in each event. This way you can still query the different staking/withdraw events and will save 375 gas for each staking/withdraw function (with the exception of _stakeLP() and _withdrawLP()).

Note that the events emitted in the _stakeLP() and withdrawLP() functions are not considered for this issue since the second indexed parameter is for the LP storage variable, which can be changed via the configureLP() function.

6. Is this possible to use costants for unchanged values 

7. If/Require checks should be top of the function 

8. Is this possible to avoid extra write ? 

struct names should be aligned way 

Unused state variables 

Cache the external function calls outside the loops

Result of the function call should be cached 

Less size uint128 incurs overhead 

Optimize names to save gas

public/external function names and public member variable names can be optimized to save gas. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save 128 gas each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save 22 gas per call, per [sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92)
